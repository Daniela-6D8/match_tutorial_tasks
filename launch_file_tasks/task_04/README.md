# Task 04

***Try to solve this task on your own and do not look at the solution until you have completed this task!***

Create a launch file that spawns three MiR200 robot platforms in the "big_square" map. Each robot should have it's own namespace. Spawn the robots in the following positions:

mir1: (0/0.5/0)

mir2: (0/-0.5/0)

mir3: (2/0.0/0)

###Hints

- Keep the old rviz config.
- Use the examples in the [arg documentation](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/arg "roslaunch documentation") to expand the include statement.
- Have a look at the `mir_200.launch` file which arguments you are able to set.
