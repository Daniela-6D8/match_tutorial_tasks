# Task 5

Add an argument "spawn_multi_robots" to the launch file from task 04. For the value "true" three robots should be created (as before), for the value "false" only one robot without namespace. 
Create another rviz config for the three robots (or modify the exisiting one). Load the correnct config depending on how many robots are spawned.
