# Task 05

***Try to solve this task on your own and do not look at the solution until you have completed this task!***

Add an argument "spawn_multi_robots" to the launch file from task 04. For the value "true" three robots should be created (as before), for the value "false" only one robot without namespace. Create another rviz config for the three robots (or modify the exisiting one). Load the correct config depending on how many robots are spawned.

###Hints

- Use two rviz configurations
- Use the [group documentation](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML#if_and_unless_attributes") for conditional statements.
