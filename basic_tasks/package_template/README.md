Create a standard ROS-package, where you also create all commonly used folders and files. Also the PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md should describe what belongs in each respective folder.

Look up the ROS-Documentation and Wiki so that you get to know all important directories and files.

Tip: look into the "match_mobile_robotics"-Repository (https://github.com/match-ROS/match_mobile_robotics)
